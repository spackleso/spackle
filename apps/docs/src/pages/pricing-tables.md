## Usage

Updating your pricing should be as easy as flipping a switch. Spackle allows you to create headless pricing tables from your Stripe products and Spackle features.

Then enable the billing intervals you would like to support. Currently, Spackle supports monthly and annual billing intervals.

#### Add products

You can add any number of supported products to your pricing table. For example, if you offer a "Basic" and "Pro" product, you can add both to your pricing table and select the pricing for each supported billing interval.
